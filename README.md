# MI-REPO

This repository was migrated from Replit and now contains a small Python
package that you can run locally. The goal is to provide a minimal example so
future development can happen in a traditional Git workflow.

## Getting started

1. Ensure you have Python 3.10 or later installed.
2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended).
3. Install the project in editable mode if you plan to extend it:

   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   ```

   (Editable installation is optional because the project has no dependencies.)
4. Run the application to verify everything works:

   ```bash
   python main.py --name "Ada"
   ```

You should see the greeting printed in your terminal.

## Project structure

```
MI-REPO/
├── main.py            # Command-line entry point
├── src/mi_repo/       # Package modules
└── README.md          # This file
```

Feel free to expand the package with additional modules or scripts as the
project evolves beyond its Replit roots.
